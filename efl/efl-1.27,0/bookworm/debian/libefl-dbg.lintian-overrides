# libefreet_trash and libefreet_mime have had all of their symbols
# moved into libefreet.  But the files must be kept to avoid breaking
# stable ABI users (consumers must be linked to libefreet anyhow).  So
# they are expected to generate no debug symbols.
#
# This override doesn't actually work due #820310.
