TODO

Before shortwave can be uploaded to experimental, some work has
to be done. For now shortwave only can be used if USENETWORK=yes
is added to pbuilderrc which is a violation of the DP.

Work to be done (feel free to add more .... )

* use debian Cargo modules 

* add missing Cargo modules to Debian repository
