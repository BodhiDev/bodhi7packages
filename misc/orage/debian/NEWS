orage (4.5.12.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The location where Orage stores its ICS calendar files has moved to
  ~/.local/share/orage. If you're upgrading from an earlier version of orage,
  don't panic when all your appointments seem to be lost, you can import them
  into the new version! Just make sure to quit orage and run the command "mv
  ~/.config/xfce4/orage/*ics ~/.local/share/orage" (without the double-quotes)
  on the command line prompt. Start orage again and your appointments are back
  again.
